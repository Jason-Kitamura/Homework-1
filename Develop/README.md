In this assignment I have cleaned up the code and made the webstire more accessible.
To clean up the code I: 

    - made sure the indentation was clear and in good form
    - made sure the title in the header was not  "website" and changed it to the company name.
    - cleaned up the sequence of elements in the sections ie. <img> <h> <p>
    - added comments to explain what each section of the code was for

To make the website more accessible I:

    - added CSS to the header anchors, so they stay in the nav bar when looking at the website on mobile devices.
    - added alt tags to the images so that people will know what they are if they don't load
